**Course:** Reinforcement Learning for Optimization in Biomechanics (TUM), Term Project (Mar–Aug 2025).  
**What:** Modeled humanoid motion with real gait data and trained a **PPO** policy in **DeepMind dm_control**.  
**How:** OpenSim processing (scaling, inverse kinematics, gait cycle extraction) → MuJoCo simulation → RL training.  
**Outcome:** Slides/presentation (add link).
