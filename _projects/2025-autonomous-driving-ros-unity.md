**Course:** Introduction to ROS (TUM), Term Project (Marâ€“Aug 2025).  
**What:** Designed an autonomous driving stack integrating perception, planning, decision-making, and control.  
**How:** Global waypoint processing, short-term goal selection, and trajectory generation with **TEB local planner** under ROS/ROS2.  
**Outcome:** Simulation demo video (add link above).
